## üõ∞Ô∏è Project Highlights
- Preloads data for popular scenarios weekly and has a simple program to prevent cache penetration.
- Utilizes Redisson distributed locks to address the overselling of scenario coupons, ensuring data atomicity under concurrency through Lua scripts.
- Employs Sorted Set to create a 'like' ranking system, presenting users with the most popular scenario data.
- Taps into Geospatial features to provide basic geographical location information, streamlining shop searches.
- Uses Bitmap to facilitate user check-in functionality.
